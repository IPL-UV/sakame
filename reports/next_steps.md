So I'm not entirely sure where we stand as of now. I would like to get an idea of all of the things that we should do in the upcoming weeks to take care of SAKAME.

* [ ] Important Decisions
  * [X] PLOS One Resubmission
  * [X] Contributions Clear
  * [X] Literative Review Rework
  * [ ] Reproducibility
    * [ ] Simple Functions
    * [ ] Toy Experiments
    * [ ] Application Data
* [ ] Reviewers Comments
* [X] Decide Experiments
  > Which experiments do we want to do? I vote to do the same with a subsection of the ESDC (Europe):
  * **GP**: Sampling Scheme with Sensitivity (How much spatial resolution)
  * **KECA**: Density Estimation (Different Alpha Values)
  * **HSIC**: Two Variables (Linear, Non-Linear)
* [ ] Clean Repo
* [ ] Refactor Code
  * [ ] Toy Data
  * [ ] Plot Class
  * [ ] Demos
    * [ ] SVM Class. Demo
    * [ ] GP Regress. Demo
    * [ ] GP Reg. Demo
    * [ ] ESDC App. Demo
* [ ] Implement Experiments
  * [ ] Do the Same Experiments
  * [ ] Extra
    * [ ] Implement HSIC (Or Find Package)
    * [ ] Implement HSIC Derivative (Ask Adrian)
    * [ ] Implement KECA (Ask Valero)
    * [ ] Implement KECA Derivative
