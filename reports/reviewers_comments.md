A Note on Derivatives in Kernel Methods
PLOS ONE

Dear Mr Johnson,

Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we have decided that your manuscript does not meet some of our criteria for publication and must therefore be rejected. In particular, we encourage the authors to clarify the major contribution of the paper and also perform experiments on real datasets to improve the technical standard of the manuscript.

I am sorry that we cannot be more positive on this occasion, but hope that you appreciate the reasons for this decision.

Yours sincerely,

Ana Roque
Academic Editor
PLOS ONE

Reviewer's Responses to Questions

Comments to the Author

1. Is the manuscript technically sound, and do the data support the conclusions?

The manuscript must describe a technically sound piece of scientific research with data that supports the conclusions. Experiments must have been conducted rigorously, with appropriate controls, replication, and sample sizes. The conclusions must be drawn appropriately based on the data presented. 

Reviewer #2: Partly
 

2. Has the statistical analysis been performed appropriately and rigorously? 

Reviewer #2: N/A
 

3. Have the authors made all data underlying the findings in their manuscript fully available?

The PLOS Data policy requires authors to make all data underlying the findings described in their manuscript fully available without restriction, with rare exception (please refer to the Data Availability Statement in the manuscript PDF file). The data should be provided as part of the manuscript or its supporting information, or deposited to a public repository. For example, in addition to summary statistics, the data points behind means, medians and variance measures should be available. If there are restrictions on publicly sharing data—e.g. participant privacy or use of data from a third party—those must be specified.

Reviewer #2: Yes
 

4. Is the manuscript presented in an intelligible fashion and written in standard English?

PLOS ONE does not copyedit accepted manuscripts, so the language in submitted articles must be clear, correct, and unambiguous. Any typographical or grammatical errors should be corrected at revision, so please note any specific errors here.

Reviewer #2: Yes

Reviewer #2: The paper analyses the derivatives of the models learnt by several kernel methods.
The topic of the paper is interesting, however it is not clear to me what is the contribution of this paper.
I believe the computation of the derivatives of different models and kernel functions is not new.
One of the motivations of this work, as stated in the Abstract and in the Introduction, is to give insights about the learned functions.
However, I think the paper fails in providing such insights.
Beginning of page 3: authors state that the derivatives can be related to the margin. The closest assessment of this sentence is in Section 3.3 and the corresponding Figure 2. The figure is a little unclear (authors don't clarify what is the y axis in the plots, I this it should be the norm of the learnt model W). In fact, the norm of W is related to the margin, but the paper doesn't clarify this.
I appreciate experiments on toy data for gaining insights on the theory. However, the aim of the proposed analysis is to gain insights on the learnt models, from real data, where such insights are actually needed.
For instance, the plots in Fig. 2 can be computed on real datasets, and the generalization performance of the learnt models varying the regularization can be assessed.
Section 6.4 looks also interesting, but it is very short and not clear enough.

I think the kind of analysis proposed by the paper is interesting, however there are some major shortcomings:
-The paper contribution is not clear
-Missing experiments on real-world datasets, that should assess if the proposed analysis may be applicable and useful to real data.

Typos:
-eq. 16, I think you meant g(f(x_*))
